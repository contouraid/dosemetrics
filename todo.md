## Tasks to complete with refactoring et al

* It appears the tests are quite surface level - many functions within the io package are not tested - update them.
* Include tests for the app package too - what kind of strategy could we use there?
* Re-think the CLI - what are typical use-cases for my own research, and what tools would help automate evaluation tasks? Write up the basic API with this in mind, and include some CLI examples as well.
